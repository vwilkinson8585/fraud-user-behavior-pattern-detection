Fraud & Player Behavior Pattern Detection — Case Study

By Vincent Wilkinson Jr.

This project analyzes user behavior on a fantasy sports and gaming-style platform. I created a realistic dataset of 30 users and looked for patterns that relate to fraud, sharp betting activity, platform risk, and overall user intent.

My goal with this case study is to show how I think about protecting a platform, spotting unusual behavior early, and understanding the difference between normal users, sharp users, and suspicious users.

What This Project Covers

• Withdrawal abuse patterns
• Device sharing and multi-accounting
• Sharp timing exploitation (injury news and stale lines)
• Stale line hunting
• Sharp-to-shadow account relationships
• Location inconsistencies
• Normal vs. suspicious behavior groups

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

• timestamps
• device IDs
• locations
• sport type (NBA or NFL)
• entry type (Flex or Power)
• stakes
• notes on user behavior

I designed this dataset of hypotheticals to simulate real scenarios that Fraud, Risk, or Game Operations teams review.

This document explains the user patterns I identified, why they matter, how they expose the platform to risk, and how I would respond if I were working on a real team.

About Me

My background isn't traditional, but I'm committed to learning and building real experience through projects like this because I have a real passion. I enjoy understanding behavior, finding patterns, and protecting platforms from risk. This is the type of work I naturally pay attention to, and I’m continuing to grow my skills with every case study I complete. From a gambling persepective this is easy work to me because im so adept to studying line movement money percentages ineffeciencies in different books, this really is my lane of work. 

Notes

I know this is not expert level, but it reflects real thinking, real effort, and real interest in Game Operations, Fraud, and Risk Analysis. I plan to continue building more projects to show my growth and development in this field because i truly believe oppurtunity meets preparation.
